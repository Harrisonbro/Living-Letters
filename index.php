			<h2 class="delta">Monasteries & Men</h2>
			<p>In the early decades of the sixteenth century, the monastic houses in Lancashire and Cheshire played an important role in the lives of every-day people, providing spiritual and sometimes physical support for their local community. The close relationship between the abbots, monks, canons and the laity contrasts with the declining functionality of monastic houses in the south of England in the same period.</p>
			<p>The North-West was viewed by those in the south as a conservative and devout county; some 50-years behind the times of the progressive communities in the capital. It is thus unsurprising that the region was unprepared for, and unwilling to accept, the religious and social changes brought about by Henry VIII, when he announced the dissolution of the smaller monasteries in 1536.</p>

			<h2 class="delta">1536: North-west unrest</h2>
			<p>In 1536 the decision was taken to close the small monasteries (those earning less than £200 a year), with the Crown taking their land and expensive possessions. This process was known as the dissolution. Men tasked with the dissolution procedures for the North-West were appointed on 24th April 1536, and they began their travels across the various monastic houses in early May 1536. The purpose of these visits was to assess the finances of the smaller monasteries, reallocating or releasing the religious men, and seizing goods and items of value, such as plate and jewels.</p>
			<p>The impending closure of the monasteries caused great anxiety amongst the conservative, devoutly Catholic community; in part, arising from the economic uncertainty of lands moving from monastic to monarchic hands. It seems likely that the close social ties between monks and the common people provoked widespread discontent.</p>

			<p>In October 1536 the common-people of the North-West rebelled against King Henry VIII and the local gentry serving in his interests. They began arming themselves in the first week of the month, which led Thomas, Lord Darcy, a local gentry man and soldier, to write to Henry and ask for a postal organisation to be set-up to allow swift communication between Lancashire and London, to allow the potential rebellion to be dealt with effectively. The rumblings in the North-West paralleled events in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, where rebels rose in protestation against religious and social reform; an event known as 'The Pilgrimage of Grace'. </p>

			<h2 class="gamma">1537: The Abbott is released</h2>
			<p>Historical records suggest that William Brereton cancelled the order to execute the abbot, due to the rebellions being quelled throughout the North - particularly the one in Yorkshire. Although, Cook (1965: 122) states 'the fate of the abbot is not known, but he is believed to have been executed', letters from Audley to Cromwell and Brereton to Cromwell suggest, instead, he was released. </p>

			<h2 class="gamma">The End of the Monasteries and the Rise of Men</h2>
			<p>Towards the end of February 1537, a royal Commission was dispatched to Lancashire to investigate those responsible for the rebellion, and to punish them accordingly. The commission collected numerous depositions from gentry and commons alike, as well as putting out an oath, swearing loyalty to the king, which was sworn by over 1000 commons and the majority of local gentry. Executions of the rebellion's ringleaders began in early March, including a number of abbots and monks from various Abbeys and priories across the county. Many monks from the smaller houses were moved to larger monasteries, or entered secular life, receiving a pension, and working a clerics or teachers.</p>
			<p>Following the dissolution of the monasteries, the Crown and the local gentry benefitted from the acquisition of the old monastic lands. Thomas Cromwell gained the lease for the lands of Furness Abbey - although this financial coup ended with his execution in 1540. One local man, Thomas Holcroft, saw substantial benefits; his local and court connections enabled him to acquire Vale Royal Abbey, as well as friaries in Lancashire. Holcroft's deputy John Braddyll also purchased ex-monastic lands, including lands at Norton and Vale Royal. Edward Stanley, Earl of Derby, did not acquire any land; despite his service to the king and his role in quelling the rebellion in southern Lancashire and north Cheshire, he was not part of the inner circle of the Court and received no free grants of lands (as did Cromwell, for example) and he was in too much debt to purchase them outright. (Haigh 1969: 135-6).</p>

				<h4>Spelling inconsistencies</h4>
				<p>Spelling in the Sixteenth Century was highly variable, even for peoples' names. Despite Piers Dutton spelling his name 'Perus' the scribe uses both 'Piers' and 'Pearse'.</p>

				<h4>The Abbots of Norton</h4>
				<p>The Abbots of Norton had a shady past. In 1522 an inquiry found that various illegal activities had taken place including the Abbot father a child with a club-foot.</p>

				<h4>Royal Seal</h4>
				<p>Thomas Cromwell was appointed 'Keeper of the Privy Seal' in July 1536, a highly prestigious position. The 'Privy Seal' was the king's personal seal, which was applied to documents to authenticate their contents, and was thus a position of considerable trust.</p>

				<h4>'-eth'</h4>
				<p>The king's scribe uses a verbal suffix '-eth' that is no longer found in Present-Day English. The modern day equivalent is '-s' e.g. it appears that, although '-eth' is sometimes associated with more formal, perhaps religious language.</p>

				<h4>What the King says vs. what the King really means</h4>
				<p>The second-half of the letter outlines the king's commands. These are explicitly linked to the king's personal will: 'our pleasure and commandment is that', using a semi-formulaic expression found elsewhere in Henry's scribal letters. Orders given to Edward Stanley, Earl of Derby, use a comparable phrase: 'Our pleasure and commandment is, that upon the receipt hereof ye shall so prepare yourself '.</p>

				<h4>Bad handwriting!</h4>
				<p>This manuscript is not the letter that was sent to Cheshire. It's actually a draft of the text, and the number of corrections, crossings-out and insertions in the second-half of the letter are typical of this stage in the letter-writing process. The question marks shown here are illegible additions. Once the letter was approved it would be re-written to be sent.</p>

				<h4>Changing his mind</h4>
				<p>Draft letters provide a valuable insight into the letter-writing process. The modifications to the draft generally tone down and generalise the instructions. Henry could have dictated the letter in one of his infamous rages before he, or his secretaries, made the revisions to achieve a calmer, more controlled tone.</p>

				<h4>Execution</h4>
				<p>The punishments of the abbots and monks involved in the uprising were often severe. Although the King's commission acquitted some North-West canons, some were imprisoned and others were put to death by hanging and hanging in chains. The execution of another Abbot was described as "a spectacle and terror to all others".</p>

				<h4>Dictation</h4>
				<p>The sheer volume of royal correspondence required to maintain contact and convey information across the realm meant that it had long been impractical for the monarch to personally write letters. Instead, secretaries were appointed to draft and write the bulk of official correspondence, which was later authenticated by the king's signature and seal</p>
