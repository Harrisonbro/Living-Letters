		<h2>About this website</h2>

		<p>We have created this website as a prototype to investigate how we can display and explore historical manuscripts in an interesting way. We've aimed to turn these seemingly impenetrable documents into something that is interesting, intriguing, informative and accessible.</p>
		<p>We hope to learn from the success (or otherwise) of this site and take this work forward to open up more documents and archives to the general public.</p>
		<p>This prototype has been made possible through the Collaborative Arts Triple Helix Project, a research project by the University of Birmingham in partnership with University of Leicester. The Collaborative Arts Triple Helix Project has been funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council as part of their Creative Economy Knowledge Exchange programme.</p>
